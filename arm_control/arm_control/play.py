"""Playing a joint trajectory on the robot, and play_trajectory, which plays one from a file.

A trajectory is what team-jax/IK motion1 real_task.plan_delivery returns (or run_real.py writes):
{"joint_names": [...], "dt": s, "positions": [[rad, ...], ...], "status": "playable", ...}, sim names.

    ros2 run arm_control play_trajectory trajectory.json --dry-run     # the checks and the schedule only
    ros2 run arm_control play_trajectory trajectory.json               # with arm_control_node running

Before anything moves, check_trajectory lists what is wrong with it: not a clean delivery in the sim,
joints the calibration would cut short, joints whose calibration is not verified. Any of them stops
the run unless --force (a run that was not delivered or not reachable never plays).

The sim moves faster than the robot may (arm_control_node holds every motor to max_speed_deg_s), so the
frames are played slower by peak joint speed / max speed: no joint is cut short and the path keeps its
shape. The first frame is held for `hold` seconds, for the arm to get there. During the playback the
AK45s are watched (watch.TrackingWatch); one that stops following stops the playback, and the arm is
told to stay where it is.
